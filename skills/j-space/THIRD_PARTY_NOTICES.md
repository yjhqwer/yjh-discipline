# Third-Party Materials

J-Space Cognition Suite source code and suite-authored text are provided under the Apache
License 2.0. Short quotations, trace fragments, research findings, names, and linked materials
from third parties remain subject to the rights and terms of their respective sources; they are
not relicensed under Apache-2.0 merely by appearing in this repository.

The suite uses quotations sparingly and otherwise summarizes or normalizes source material.
Point-of-use links in the reference files identify the immediate source. Principal external
materials include:

- Anthropic, [*Verbalizable Representations Form a Global Workspace in Language
  Models*](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2026/workspace/index.html), and the companion
  [research article](https://www.anthropic.com/research/global-workspace).
- Anthropic, [*Claude Fable 5 & Claude Mythos 5 System
  Card*](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/2f9323abbcc4abe219577539efe19a623c9ca2bd/Claude%20Fable%205%20%26%20Claude%20Mythos%205%20System%20Card.pdf).

  `references/j-space-science.md` beneath the skill directory, including
  arXiv:2510.27338, arXiv:2509.15541, arXiv:2501.12948, and arXiv:1704.06960.

## Engineering references

The suite summarizes the following materials in
`references/engineering-evidence.md` beneath the skill directory and derives its own
operating protocols. No third-party source code is incorporated from these projects:

- Thariq Shihipar / Anthropic, [A field guide to Claude Fable: Finding your unknowns](https://claude.com/blog/a-field-guide-to-claude-fable-finding-your-unknowns).
- Stanford, UC Berkeley, and NVIDIA collaborators, [LLM-as-a-Verifier](https://llm-as-a-verifier.com/) and its [repository](https://github.com/llm-as-a-verifier/llm-as-a-verifier).
- Pappu et al., [Multi-Agent Teams Hold Experts Back](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/multi-agent-teams-experts).
- LangChain, [OpenWiki](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openwiki).
- Xu et al., [Re-Reading Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06275).
- DeepSeek-AI, [DeepSeek-V3 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19437).

Source links identify the authors' results and current terms. Suite-authored mappings from
research to runtime behavior are engineering interpretations, not reproduced benchmark
results or claims of affiliation. Short category labels retain their source attribution.

## Public Fable 5 / Codeforces trace

Selected short lines in `j-space/references/exemplars.md`,
`j-space/references/induction-playbook.md`, `j-space/references/j-space-science.md`, and the routed
`capacity`, `empirics`, `markers`, and `shorthand` modules are transcribed from screenshots in the
Reddit post by u/No-Head-Royal linked above. The post identifies the material as Fable 5 web
output generated while attempting Codeforces 2239D. The suite treats this as a publicly
inspectable, poster-attributed trace artifact: it supports what is visible in the screenshots,
but does not independently establish model provenance, prevalence, or causal mechanism.
Anthropic's system card remains a separate official evidence stream.

Only selected textual fragments are reproduced. Line wrapping, ellipses, emphasis, ordering
labels, plain-language expansions, protocol transitions, and surrounding bookkeeping may be
editorial or suite-authored; the screenshots and full conversation are not redistributed here.
Point-of-use notes distinguish transcribed fragments from suite-authored explanation.

The Reddit post, screenshots, and their underlying content are third-party materials. Reddit's
[User Agreement](https://redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement) states that users retain whatever
ownership rights they have in their content. The link-back and username provisions in Reddit's
[Developer Terms](https://redditinc.com/policies/developer-terms) apply within developer-service
use and do not provide a general repository-redistribution license. Inclusion here therefore
does not transfer ownership or relicense these excerpts under Apache-2.0; redistributors must
determine whether an applicable license, exception, or permission covers their use. Any rights
and terms of the poster, Reddit, Anthropic, Codeforces, or other applicable rightsholders remain
applicable. The adjacent expansions, analysis, and protocol bookkeeping authored for this suite
remain covered by the repository's Apache-2.0 license.

If a contribution adds external text, data, images, traces, or code, it must identify the source,
author, link, applicable license, permission, or other lawful basis, and any modifications or
truncation.
